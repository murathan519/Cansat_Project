# Cansat_Project
I joined a cansat team in 2021 as electronic and software crew leader. I frequently worked with my crew member Osman Ã–zcan and we designed control subsystem, electronical subsystem and software subsystem of the cansat. I also designed communication subsystem with Berfin Duman. 

Here is the list of the things that we done:

8km distance line of sight 2.4GHz Wi-Fi communication with selected antennas and router.
Circuit design of cansat with Altium.
Sensor selections and calibrations.
Flight software of payload for data handling, data processing, video transfering, live broadcasting and command exchanging with ground station.
PID controller design for payload.
Motor-ESC-Battery selections and calibrations.
Minimalistic electronic subsystem design with just 135g including batteries, circuitry, camera, antenna, cables, sensors and microcontroller.
